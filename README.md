# Tortuga 1667

This project is my attempt at creating an online version of the excellent
board game [Tortuga 1667] by [Facade Games]. The game mechanics, and all
graphical assets (unless explicitly stated otherwise) are their property.

## Server installation

You should be able to run this by cloning the repository and running
`npm install` in the target directory.

Use `npm start` to run the server.

## Where are the images?

I'm not sure I should upload them to Github. It's not (mainly) a matter of size
but rather a matter of copyright and ownership. If I ever decide to host a
publicly accessible version of this, I will probably end up giving the assets.

In the meantime, if you really want it to look good (or look like anything at
all) and you don't want to remake everything yourself from images found all
over Internet, contact me.

## How do I donate to you?

As much as I'd appreciate that, don't. Go to [Facade Games][Tortuga 1667] and
buy the original board game for yourself, it's well worth your money (and the
potential loss of friendships)!

## Credits

Just in case this hasn't gotten into your skull yet: I'm merely a developer
with too much time on their hands. All credits for the game mechanics and art
go to [Facade Games], and you can get Tortuga 1667 [here][Tortuga 1667]. Enjoy!
